```
1. Order objects in ascending order of value ratio of agent-b-value / agent-a-value
2. Initialization: give all objects to agent-a
3. Give objects to agent-b in order util:
	1. Sum of values of agent-a equals to sum of values of agent-b
	Or:
	2. There is a one object that if we cut him the values will be equal
```
